## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Site URL

- [Live Site URL](https://huddle-landing-page-with-curved-sections-rose.vercel.app/)

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5, CSS3
- Dart Sass
  - variables, mixins, placeholders
  - built-in modules (`sass:color`, `sass:map`)
  - `@use`, `@forward` keywords instead of `@import`
- Font Awesome icons

### What I learned

- I definitely deepened my understanding of SASS
- Also, this was my first site built according to *mobile first* approach

### Continued development

- Now, I'm set on learning *tailwindcss* framework.
